# IPARO Frontend
This is the frontend interactive implementation of the IPARO web archival system. When complete, users will be able to view a snapshot of a website's archived data, or submit a URL for the site to start tracking.

# Quick Start Guide
To quickly get the IPARO frontend simulation up and running, first make sure you are in the project directory. Then, execute ```cd frontend``` in a terminal to make sure you are in the ```frontend/``` directory. 

Once in ```frontend/```, enter the following in the terminal:

```npm install```

```npm start```

After a moment, the server should now be running on ```localhost:3000```.

Note that the site will not function properly without also running the backend. Instructions for running the backend can be found in our [backend README](https://github.com/johnnguyenn77/iparo/blob/main/backend/README.md).
