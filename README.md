# IPARO Implementation with IPFS

This repository contains a basic implementation of InterPlanetary Archival Record Objects (IPAROs) using IPFS based on a [proposal](https://github.com/johnnguyenn77/iparo/blob/main/proposal.pdf) by Dr. Sawood Alam. The implementation demonstrates the creation, storage, linking, and retrieval of IPAROs using different linking strategies.
